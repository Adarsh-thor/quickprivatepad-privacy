# Privacy Policy - QuickPrivatePad

## Your Privacy Matters

This notes app is designed to be completely offline to ensure your privacy. Everything you write is stored only on your device and never uploaded or shared.

## How Your Data is Stored

• **100% Offline** – Your notes are saved locally on your device and are never sent anywhere.

• **No Tracking, No Data Collection** – The app does not track, store, or share any of your information.

• **No Cloud Syncing** – Your notes remain private and only accessible by you.

## Saving Your Notes

If you ever want to back up your notes, you can use the "Save All Notes as ZIP" option. This will save all your notes as a ZIP file in your device's Downloads folder, allowing you to keep a backup safely.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is my data safe? Can anyone read my notes?**

A: Yes, your notes are completely safe. Everything is stored locally, and no one—including the developer—can access them.

**Q: Does this app track me or collect data?**

A: No, the app does not track, collect, or store any user data. It is built to work completely offline.

**Q: You say the app is 100% offline with no tracking, but ads need internet and tracking. How does this work?**

A: Simple - your notes and ads are completely separate!

• Your notes are 100% offline - they never leave your device and we can't read them even if we wanted to

• Ads are optional - you only go online when you choose to watch an ad for coins

• We don't track you, and your note content is never involved - Google AdMob handles standard ad tracking separately from us, without seeing what you write

• Think of it like a private diary with ads on the cover - the ads can't peek inside your diary

We never scan your notes for ads. That would break our privacy promise!

**Q: What happens if I uninstall the app?**

A: Since your notes are saved on your device, uninstalling the app may delete them permanently. Use the "Save All Notes as ZIP" option to create a backup before uninstalling.

**Q: What if unexpected events or device issues occur?**

A: While the app is designed to be robust, unforeseen circumstances like unexpected events or device issues can lead to data loss. We highly recommend regularly using the "Save All Notes as ZIP" feature to back up your notes to your device's Downloads folder.
